summary:
abstract: "Modern society is unsustainable. This fact highlights the imperative for transformational change to the industrial system and the materials basis of modern society, i.e., the ‘total materials system’. ‘Computational industrial ecology’ is an emerging approach that aims to leverage data and modelling tools to quantify the total materials system in order to understand how to improve its efficiency and reduce its environmental burdens. The Industrial Ecology Team is currently working towards this aim by developing a data structure for sustainability science data, a relational database to efficiently contain these data for querying, and an algorithm to unify these data into a model of the total materials system. In this seminar, we will introduce industrial ecology, discuss current research activities, and identify some potential areas for future research."
