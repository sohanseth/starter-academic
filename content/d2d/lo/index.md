abstract: "Much of the routine data generated during the provision of medical care in critical care units is discarded rather than fully used to help clinicians improve treatments. Multi-centre ‘intensive-care big-data’ initiatives such as the adult BrainIT group have successfully improved adult brain trauma care with new research ideas and data-driven improvement interventions. With the support of a prestigious EU grant, I have successfully set- up a new paediatric brain trauma ‘big-data’ initiative (KidsBrainIT) that uses high-quality bedside physiological data from patients recruited in 15 PICU in 5 countries to better understand the importance of bespoke management improvements (e.g. treatment of increased brain pressure from brain swelling). I am using KidsBrainIT as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the benefits of data-intensive informatics in improvement research and to translate this concept into IMPACT-ACE that will ultimately improve patient care, safety and outcome in the broader critical-care setting and other medical specialities in the future. In this talk, I will summarise the challenges we have overcome using this research approach and how we may make better use of big data generated routinely within critical care units."
