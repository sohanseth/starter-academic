Data Scientist, once-Neuroscientist, all-round-geek (and sleep enthusiast) with a varied background. Experience ranging from basic research through building and deploying ML models in a business environment - to guiding tours on river Cam. Interested in applying Data Science for societal improvement (but generally into *any* problem solving, so I suppose my character alignment is 'chaotic good' ;))
