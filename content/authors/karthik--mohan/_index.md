Data Scientist, with close to six years of experience in developing data science solutions - from conceptualization to building data pipelines to modelling and reporting, for businesses across various industries such as sportswear retail, mass media, oil and gas, automobiles among others. Experienced in a wide range of tools and techniques used in an industry setting. I believe one of the most important skills for a data scientist is adaptability. I am interested in making a positive impact on society using the power of data and machine learning.
